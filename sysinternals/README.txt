 Name
  SysInternals
 Description
  SysInternals is a set of Windows tools that allow the user to analyze system information easily. Most of the tools provide some sort of GUI interface for ease of use. 
 Your personal review
  SysInternals was an easy to use suite of tools that I really enjoy. They offer the user a graphical look at the data versus simply looking at plaintext. It can be daunting at first to decide which tools to use but after some practice, it seems there are some go-to tools that provide an decent overview of what is going on with the machine.
 Your personal notes on usage
  Some of my favorite tools are:
    • procmon: view active processes
    • pslist: list all processes
    • psfile: list open files
    • psloggedon: view logged on users
    • psservice: view all services
    • psinfo: process information
    • strings: converts dump file into readable text
